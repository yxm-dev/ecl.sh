[ecl.sh](https://github.com/yxm-dev/ecl.sh) is a collection of pure shell scripts and bash functions aimed to
make command line easier. It includes:

* quickly navigation with "`.`", "`..`" and "`~`"
* unified function `mk` that creates files, directories or symbolic links
* secure deletion with `del` (or `d`) moving to trash instead of doing a strong delete, and `D` asking to
  confirm before a strong delete
* a function `vl` to quickly and intuitively manage audio trough `amixer`
* a simple script `bkl` to manage brightness backlight without the need of `xbacklight`, `light` or other
  software
* a function `wf` to connect easily connect to internet through `nmcli`.
